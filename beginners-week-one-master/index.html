<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
<ol id=contents>
  <li>
HTML is cool
</li>
<li>
CSS is cooler
</li>
<li>
JS is the best
</li>
</ol>

<h2> <em> What do you need to create a website? </em> </h2>

Not much!


<li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
